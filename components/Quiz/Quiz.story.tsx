                Happy Birthday, I thought of writing something nice inside your card but then I decided to
                write a web address instead, much more romantice ðŸ˜Š <br />
                I&apos;ve been at this for about 3 hours now, and I&apos;m still not finished but trust me,
                you&apos;re worth it. <br />
                I honestly don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do without you, or for that matter how I survived
                before we met. <br />
                You make my every day better and so I hope this gives you the slightest idea of how much I
                love you. <br />
                I&apos;d do anything for you, all you need to do is ask. <br />
                Have a great birthday! (WITH ME! :D). <br />
                <br />
